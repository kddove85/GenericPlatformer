# GenericPlatformer


This codebase should have everything you need to make a standard environment for a generic platformer:

- 1 Tileset for creating a level
- 1 Opening animation featuring the Godot Logo as well as a sample company logo
- 1 Menu navigational by controller
- 1 Fade Screen transition that can be used by any scene

The codebase does NOT include:

- A character to play as - this was just too complicated given that people have different needs for physics and controls
- Any enemies for the player
- Any collectibles for the given level
